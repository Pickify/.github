##  Pickify

This project entails: 
* Development of a viable MVP (functional specification, system architecture and implementation),
applying software enterprise architecture patterns.
*  Specification and enforcement of a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) strategy, applied throughout the
software engineering process


The project was divided into two parts, the e-Commerce company (e-Byte) and the Logistics Platform (Pickify). The two segments of the assignment are in separate repositories under this Organization. 

The **Pickify Platform** consists of a logistics platform which utilizes and manages a network of PickUp Points. It will allow other Business to Business colaboration and members of staff and Associate PickUp Points to interact with the platform.

The e-Commerce company, e-Byte, consists of a simple web application that allows users to place orders and track order status progress of the orders placed under the Pickify Platform.
